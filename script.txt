Features of Dataframe describe signals that act both as biological reactions and their visible symptoms

Groups of Features:
- Vascular health / heart:
    - systolic / relaxation (symptoms)
    - HDL, LDL, triglyceride (and Cholesterol)

- Liver:
    - AST, ALT, gtp
    - urine protein as symptom

- BMI / Body Fat
    - height + weight

- remaining 
    - hearing
    - eyesight
    - waist
    - tartar / dental caries
    - serum creatinine

Two main focus:
- ygtp
- heart via triglyceride

Heart:
- research shows: triglyceride is higher for smokers, LDL higher, HDL lower
- partially supported by dataset; stagnant LDL and HDL values, but clear indices through triglyceride


Liver:
    - gtp, ALT and AST as indicators of liver health
    - gtp more of a pre-warning, with higher ALT and AST linked to direct damage (but later)
    - the significance of y-gtp is a lot higher, as it is an early indicator, while other 2 are symptoms (check this)
