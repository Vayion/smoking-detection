Features of Dataframe describe signals that act both as biological reactions and their visible symptoms

Groups of Features:
- Vascular health / heart:
    - systolic / relaxation (symptoms)
    - HDL, LDL, triglyceride (and Cholesterol)

- Liver:
    - AST, ALT, gtp
    - urine protein as symptom

- BMI / Body Fat
    - height + weight

- remaining 
    - hearing
    - eyesight
    - waist
    - tartar / dental caries
    - serum creatinine

Two main focus:
- ygtp
- heart via triglyceride

Heart:
- research shows: triglyceride is higher for smokers, LDL higher, HDL lower
- partially supported by dataset; stagnant LDL and HDL values, but clear indices through triglyceride


Liver:
    - gtp, ALT and AST as indicators of liver health
    - gtp more of a pre-warning, with higher ALT and AST linked to direct damage (but later)
    - the significance of y-gtp is a lot higher, as it is an early indicator, while other 2 are symptoms (check this)





Overall Approach
- Background
    - Effects of Smoking on Different organs
        - Heart
        - Liver
        - mention lung maybe

- Methodology
    - introduce Significance Testing
    - create both Support Vector Machine and RandomForestClassifier
    - feature engineering
        - ability to validate feature engineering through significance testing
- Results
    - triglyceride and gpt as most noteworthy indicators
    - weight and height -> bmi more as a symptom
